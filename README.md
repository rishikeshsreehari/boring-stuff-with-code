# boring-stuff-with-code

This repository contains short pieces of code that I use for automating boring tasks usually at work that were too complex to be done manually.

- Works smoothly upto 3200 unread emails. Can result in error at times if the execution time is too long

Most of these are written in Python or Javascript in Google Apps with the help from ChatGPT
