This Google Apps script checks your gmail for unread emails and identifies the senders with the number of unread emails. This is a useful way to identify junk emails or subscriptions in your inobx. The code takes some time to run based on the number of emails you have and sends an email with results.

Repalce 'RECIPIENT EMAIL' with the email where you want the results to be.

Requires permission to access your gmail for reading inbox and sending email!
